# Diablo II save file generator

Generate valid d2s file using simple parameters.

During development, I used following resources that describes d2s file format:
- [krisives/d2s-format](https://github.com/krisives/d2s-format)
- [nokka/d2s](https://github.com/nokka/d2s)
- [Diablo II Saved Game File Format](https://user.xmission.com/~trevin/DiabloIIv1.09_File_Format.shtml)

Test cases for character at level 1 was prepared using Diablo II LoD v.1.14d. Test cases was prepared using [Hero Editor v1.04](https://www.moddb.com/games/diablo-2-lod/downloads/hero-editor-v-104) together with values calculated with [maxroll.gg D2 planner](https://maxroll.gg/d2/d2planner/).
